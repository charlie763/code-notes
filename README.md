## Description
Code Notes is my Rails portfolio project for the Flatiron coding bootcamp. It is an application for taking, organizing, and searching for notes about software development. A live demo of the application can be found at [https://notes-on-code.herokuapp.com](https://notes-on-code.herokuapp.com).

## Installation and Usage
To install, clone the repository and run `bundle install`. The gemfile specifies dependencies. Database configuration is specified in the `config/database.yml` file and environmental variables are set in the `.env` file. To make the github omniauth work a Github KEY and SECRET need to be added as environmental variables.

Here is an ERD of the models used in the application:
